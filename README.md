# Bachelor's thesis

Hi everyone, this is the repository of my bachelor's thesis.

As it can be seen, the repository is split up in four branches. Each one of them contains one part of the thesis.

— The “master” branch contains the final solution.

— The “development” branch contains everything related to the programming part.

— The “LaTeX” branch contains everything related with the documentation part.

— The “theory” branch contains everything related with the theoretical information part.

As the title of the report says, the thesis is consists in creating an intelligent model able to classify an MRI image according to the Alzheimer's level the patient has.

In order to write a document with all the “good redaction practices”, LaTeX has been used.

The model is a CNN, and it has been implemented in the Python programming language.

The structure of the model has been built using TensorFlow and Keras libraries.

The model is saved inside a “.h5” file.

An “.h5 is” one of the Hierarchical Data Formats (HDF) used to store large amount of data. It is used to store large amount of data in the form of multidimensional arrays. The format is primarily used to store scientific data that is well-organized for quick retrieval and analysis.
